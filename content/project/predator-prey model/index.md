The simplest model of interaction of two types of "predator - prey" -
Lotka-Volterra model. This two-species model is based on
the following assumptions:
- The population numbers of prey x and predators y depend only on time
(the model does not take into account the spatial distribution of the population by
occupied territory)
- In the absence of interaction, the number of species changes by the model
Malthus, with the number of prey increasing and the number of predators falling.
- Natural mortality of the prey and natural birth rate of the predator
are considered insignificant
- The saturation effect of both populations is not considered
- The rate of increase in the number of prey decreases proportionally
predator abundances
